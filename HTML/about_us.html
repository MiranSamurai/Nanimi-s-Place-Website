    <div class="our-story-text"> Our Story
        <div class="about-us"> Founded by Kento Nanami, a passionate sushi chef with over 19 years of experience, Nanami's Place was born from a love for fresh ingredients and the art of sushi-making. The journey began in a small kitchen, where A Young Stupid guy Honed his craft and dreamt of bringing the true essence of Japanese cuisine to our community.

            In the years since, we have grown from a modest establishment into a beloved local gem, known for our commitment to quality and authenticity. Our restaurant features a warm and inviting atmosphere, reflecting the essence of Japan while making every guest feel at home.
